**Deprecated**
`async/await` is now natively supported in Node as of v7.6, so you don't need to use babel for your project.

# Koa v2 Skeleton
> A simple boilerplate for creating a web-app with Koa 2.

### Install
You can download this app by doing one of the following: 

1. Use the <kbd>Download Zip</kbd> button at the top right.
2. Run `$ git clone git@github.com:saadq/koa2-skeleton.git` in the command line.

Once you've downloaded the app, run `npm install` to get the necessary dependencies for the project.

### Starting the server
Once you have all your dependencies installed, you can run `npm start` to start the server and then you can head over to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### Usage
If you want to change the templating engine, simply remove `jade` from the dependencies and change the extension from `'jade'` to whatever you want to use in the `app.js` file.
